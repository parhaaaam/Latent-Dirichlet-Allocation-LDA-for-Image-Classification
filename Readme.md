# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Image Classification

## Overview

This project employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative statistical model commonly used to identify topics in a collection of documents, for the purpose of image classification. By treating discernible elements within images as "words", we can apply LDA to categorize images into "topics", effectively grouping similar images together based on their content.

## LDA Algorithm Explained

LDA is based on the premise that documents are mixtures of topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over a fixed vocabulary. The key idea is that documents exhibit multiple topics but to different degrees. Hereâ€™s how LDA applies to our image classification problem:

- **'Documents':** In our scenario, each image in the dataset is analogous to a document in text analysis.
- **'Words':** The elements or features within an image, which could be edges, textures, colors, or any identifiable segment, represent the words.
- **'Topics':** For images, a topic could be a specific pattern or theme that emerges from the combination of features, such as 'outdoor scenes' or 'urban landscapes'.

The LDA algorithm tries to backtrack from the documents to find a set of topics that are likely to have generated the collection. In images, we first need to extract features that will represent our "words". Once we have this representation, LDA can be used to learn the topic distribution in each image and the word distribution within topics.

## Project Implementation

The implementation of this project involves the following steps:

1. **Feature Extraction:** Convert images into a suitable representation of elements. This might involve using edge detection, segmentation, or other computer vision techniques to identify distinct features within each image.
2. **LDA Application:** Apply the LDA algorithm to the set of extracted image features to discover the latent topics.
3. **Classification:** Match images to topics. Each image will have a distribution over the range of topics, and the primary topic(s) can be used to classify the image within the dataset.
4. **Dataset Matching:** Compare the topic distribution of a new image with those of images in the dataset to find the best match.

## Usage

To use this project, you will need a set of images and a pre-existing dataset with categorized images. The system will:

1. Extract features from the new images.
2. Use LDA to determine the topic distribution based on the learned dataset.
3. Match new images to the dataset categories through their topic similarities.

# Installation

This repository contains a simple Python application which is Dockerized for easy deployment and execution.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Docker on your machine. Installation guides for Docker can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Docker Setup

To run this application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

### Build the Docker Image

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (if you have not already):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/parhaaaam/Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-LDA-for-Image-Classification.git
    cd LDA
    ```

2. Build the Docker image using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t LDA .
    ```

    This command will use the `Dockerfile` in the current directory to build a Docker image named `my-python-app`.

### Run the Docker Container

After the image has been successfully built, you can run the container:

```bash
docker run --name my-running-app LDA
```
